# House Quest 3D
Our idea is that we are trying to make a 3D gamified simulation of properties to improve visualization, explore, and customize your next home.
## There are two ways in today’s world to find a property online:
### Through photos like on 99acres.com:
What they do is show you photos and sometimes maps uploaded via homeowners with the price tag and real-life location and reviews on the basis of which users select their homes.
#### Problems with this:
Users might have to ask for new photos if they don’t get the complete picture of the project.
Users have to view photos many times as sometimes they don't get one continuous shot of the picture.
### Through Google Street Map Views like on magicbricks.com: 
What they do is stitch photos of the same object through multiple angles so that you can view that place in one continuous shot without interruption.
#### Problems with this:
Users have a static view of objects which isn’t changed often as it is a time-consuming process.

## What WE ARE TRYING TO DO TO ELIMINATE THESE PROBLEMS:
1.) We will create a 3D simulated game environment with the same input as given by users to the normal property viewing sites like 99acres and magicbricks and use this to create the 3D environment for the first time on a minimal fee basis.

2.) We will deploy this model on a site much like 99acres or magicbricks for comfort viewing of the user. We are not trying to sell these properties via VR alone as the user base doesn’t generally possess a VR headset instead we are trying to simulate a simple game-like environment to the user for their comfort viewing.

3.) We will allow users the option to edit their homes on the basis of a small fee and allow them to edit their homes and add furniture and buy those furniture at the same time using openable links earning a small fee on each object sold from the vendors as well.

4.) All of this will be available to the user for their comfort viewing using our website.

5.) Also we have come up with the concept of timestamps using which we can view a property model created once anytime and anywhere forever and can update those models once they reach a certain amount of time based on the owner’s need as well as on user reviews.
